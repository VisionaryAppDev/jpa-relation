"orphanRemoval = true" is an attribute of JPA's @OneToMany annotation. It specifies that when an entity is removed from a One-To-Many relationship, it should also be deleted from the database.

In other words, if you have a parent entity (e.g., an Order entity) that holds a collection of child entities (e.g., OrderDetails), and you remove one of the OrderDetails from the collection, the "orphanRemoval = true" attribute will cause the removed OrderDetail to be deleted from the database.

This is useful to prevent orphaned records in the database, where a child entity is left without a corresponding parent entity.


Let's say you have two entities: Order and OrderDetail. Order has many OrderDetails.

If you set orphanRemoval=true on the OrderDetail (check Order.java class) entity, it means that when you delete an OrderDetail from the Order, the OrderDetail will also be deleted from the database.

For example:

```
Order order = entityManager.find(Order.class, orderId);
order.getOrderDetails().remove(orderDetail); 
```

Here, when you remove the OrderDetail from the Order, the OrderDetail will also be deleted from the database because orphanRemoval=true.

If you set orphanRemoval=false, it means that when you remove an OrderDetail from the Order, it will not be deleted from the database. It will only break the relationship between Order and OrderDetail.

In summary, orphanRemoval allows you to specify whether deleting an entity should also delete any entities that are related to it.
