# NOTES
In this package, Country is annotated with `@JoinColumn(name = "capital_id")`. The __capital_id__ is a column in the Country table. We used this column as a key to map back to the Capital table. In case you want Capital entity to query Country back, you may need the Capital to hold the reference (country_id) of the Country. You have to decide which side should contain the extra column in order to map back.
